# Indian Culture Django Application

Heritage is what we inherit from our ancestors and from our past. India is a land of varied cultures and traditions. People from numerous castes, religions, and creeds reside in our country. Each ethnic group in our country has its own tale of origin and its set of unique traditions and culture. They have all contributed to the making of Indian history and culture. Through this website we have tried to bring an exquisite experience for the users as a combination of both Indian legacy and cultures at its finest.
